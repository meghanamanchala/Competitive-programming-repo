//Problem -3 : Coin change

// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

// Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

// Solution:

class problem3 {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] minCoins = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(minCoins, amount + 1);
        minCoins[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
                if (i - coins[j] >= 0) {
                    minCoins[i] = Math.min(minCoins[i], 1 + minCoins[i - coins[j]]);
                }
            }
        }

        return minCoins[amount] != amount + 1 ? minCoins[amount] : -1;        
    }
}
