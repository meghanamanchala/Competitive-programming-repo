//Problem -1 : Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array  

// Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

// [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
// [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
// Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

// Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

//Solution:


//Brute Force
class problem1 {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int min = nums[0];
        for(int i =0;i<nums.length;i++){
             min = Math.min(min,nums[i]);
        }
        return min;
    }
}

//But its not O(log n)

class problem1 {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while(left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if(nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return nums[left];
    }
